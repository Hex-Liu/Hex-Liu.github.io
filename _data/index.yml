- title: Cash Flow Matching with Random Variable Sources and Uses
  abstract: >
              The client, S. LLC. is planning to construct a multi-family rental building marketed to graduate students attending
              Bucknell University in PA. The development is expected to finish in 2 years with expenditures occuring semi-annually. Based on cost calculations and revenue projections, the client plans to finance the development with both debt and equity,and has secured a lender to help pay for the building's development costs (Table1). The client wants to minimize the present value of equity ammount needed to be raised. (Per the client, capital can only be raised once at t=0 )
  model: >
            To minimize the capital needed to cover required payments, we suggest the client to invest the initial raised equity into some risky corporate bonds and risk-free flex account (Table 2). We model the semi-annually expenditures as randoms variables (rvs)(Table 3), and since the lender's payments are contractual thus deterministic, the client's payments must include any cost overruns or savings thus stochastic. As with many risky bonds since the implementation of the Dodd-Frank act, liquidity is limited. We assume good spreads and purchase prices for all the bonds are only available in lots of 50, 100, 150 and 200.
            </br></br>
            <b>Risk-Reward Policy:</b></br>
              &nbsp;Reward: Minimize amount of funds raised and invested in bonds.</br>
              &nbsp;Risk:   Demand a 90% probability or more that the remaining cash balance at the end of the project is positive.
            </br></br>
            We find, via optimization , that investing all the raised capital into riskys bonds at t=0 is the optimal strategy. Then, by simulation, we are able to identify one specific bonds invetment combination that will minimize initial capital raise.

- title: Multi-Period Portfolio Optimization under Uncertainty
  abstract: >
              The client operates as a homebuilding company throughout the U.S., acquiring unoccupied land, it then constructs and sells single family and multi-family homes.
              </br></br>
              The company then has decided to enter into a $110K, six-year (24 quarter) land option deal in Maryland, on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. It will pay $10K now (T=0, EOQ 0) for the right to purchase the land for $125K at the end of six years (end of the 24th quarter, EOQ 24). The client will put $100K into a set of assets today, in the hope that this will grow to at least the amount needed by EOQ 24. We are asked to give some advices on which category they should invest among Stock, Bond, and CDs.
              </br></br>
              <b>Risk-Reward Policy:</b> Minimize probability that the ending balance less than needed ($125K). (Tweaked VaR).
              </br></br>
              We now consider only on 3 general investment options with or without quarterly rebalancing:
              <dl>
                <li> HYS: short-term, high-yeild bond ETF </li>
                <li> SPY: S&P 500 ETF</li>
                <li> CD: Certificate Deposit</li>
              </dl>
  model: >
          We first modeel the Price of HYS or SPY follows Geometric Brownion Motion, justied via Auto-Correlation in which daily growths are independent. Then with the calculated Statistics and Correlation Coeficient among HYS, SPY, and CD, we will examine all possible weighting combinations of 0%-100% for each of the three primary assets in 20% increments, where the total amount adds to 100%. For each valid weighting combination, we then find the expected value ending balance at EOQ 24 (not the gain), and the probability that the balance will be greater than needed to purchase the land.

          <b>Conclusion:</b> Given the high volatility associated, we advice the client to avoid investing S&P 500, and seek the combination between short-term & high-yeild bond ETF and CDs that fits their risk flavor .
